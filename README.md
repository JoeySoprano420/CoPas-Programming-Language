### **3. Core Concepts and Terminology**

Before diving into the details, let's define some key terms used within the **CoPas Runtime**:

- **Memory Pools**: Pre-allocated memory segments used for managing variables and data efficiently.
- **Call Stack**: The data structure that tracks function calls, variable scopes, and execution flow.
- **Expression**: A combination of variables, constants, and operators evaluated to produce a result.
- **Statements**: Executable instructions like assignments, conditionals, loops, etc.
- **Node**: A reusable computational block or function that can be dynamically called during execution.

---

### **4. Memory Allocation and Management**

The **CoPas Runtime** uses an optimized memory management system designed for high-speed operations.

#### **Allocating Variables**:
To allocate memory for a variable in **CoPas**, use the `allocate()` method:
```python
co_pas_runtime.allocate('var_name', 'int', 100)
```
Where:
- `'var_name'`: Name of the variable.
- `'int'`: Data type (`'int'`, `'float'`, `'str'`).
- `100`: Initial value (optional, depending on type).

#### **Managing Memory Pools**:
Memory pools are used to manage and reuse allocated memory. They prevent fragmentation and ensure high performance.

```python
co_pas_runtime.memory_pools['int_pool'] = co_pas_runtime.allocate_pool('int', size=1024)
```

---

### **5. Variable Handling**

#### **Getting and Setting Variables**:
You can retrieve or modify the value of a variable in memory using the `get_variable()` and `set_variable()` methods.

```python
# Get the value of 'x'
x_value = co_pas_runtime.get_variable('x')

# Set the value of 'y' to 200
co_pas_runtime.set_variable('y', 200)
```

#### **Supported Variable Types**:
- **int**: Integer values.
- **float**: Floating-point values.
- **str**: String values (text).

---

### **6. Expression Evaluation and Execution**

**CoPas** supports complex expressions that can include variables, operators, and function calls.

```python
# Expression (x + y)
result = co_pas_runtime.run_expression(('+', 'x', 'y'))
```

#### **Supported Operators**:
- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<` (Comparison operators)

---

### **7. Parallel Execution**

The **CoPas Runtime** supports parallel execution of tasks through threading and multiprocessing.

#### **Running Parallel Tasks**:
To run tasks in parallel:
```python
tasks = [{'type': 'ASSIGNMENT', 'var': 'z', 'value': 100}]
co_pas_runtime.start_parallel_tasks([tasks, tasks, tasks])
```

#### **Managing Thread Pools**:
The runtime automatically manages a pool of threads for executing tasks, ensuring optimal CPU utilization.

---

### **8. Export and Packaging**

**CoPas** allows you to export your application, complete with all dependencies, to different platforms.

#### **Exporting a Package**:
You can export your application for different platforms by specifying the target platform:

```python
co_pas_runtime.export_package('my_app', target_platform="linux")
```

---

### **9. Rendering and Graphics**

The **CoPas Runtime** includes GPU acceleration and optimized rendering pipelines.

#### **Rendering Features**:
- **GPU-Accelerated Rendering**: Enable GPU acceleration for rendering operations.
- **Ray Tracing**: Realistic lighting and shadow effects for high-quality visuals.
- **Dynamic Level of Detail (LOD)**: Adjust the quality of the rendering based on the distance from the viewer.

---

### **10. Security and Encryption**

Security is a top priority in **CoPas**, and it includes built-in encryption for sensitive data.

#### **Encrypting Data**:
```python
encrypted = co_pas_runtime.encrypt_data('SensitiveData')
```

#### **Decrypting Data**:
```python
decrypted = co_pas_runtime.decrypt_data(encrypted)
```

---

### **11. Dynamic Rule Management**

You can define and apply rules dynamically within **CoPas** to influence execution behavior.

#### **Defining Rules**:
Rules can be defined as conditions that adjust execution behavior:
```python
co_pas_runtime.apply_rule('performance_threshold', {'max_cpu': 85})
```

#### **Real-Time Rule Adjustment**:
Modify the rules at runtime to adapt to changing conditions.

---

### **12. Troubleshooting and Debugging**

The **CoPas Runtime** includes several built-in debugging tools.

#### **Enabling Debugging**:
```python
co_pas_runtime.debugger_enabled = True
```

#### **Common Debugging Commands**:
- `step` – Step through the code line-by-line.
- `continue` – Resume execution until the next breakpoint.
- `inspect` – Inspect the current values of variables and memory.
